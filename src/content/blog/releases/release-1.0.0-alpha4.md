   Announcing Serverless Workflow Specification 1.0.0-alpha4: Critical Validation Fixes
---

We’re excited to announce the release of **Serverless Workflow Specification 1.0.0-alpha4**! This update is critical as it addresses a key issue that has impacted the community: the schema’s URI template. With this release, validation hurdles that developers previously encountered have been effectively resolved.

## Why This Fix Matters
Validation is a cornerstone of the Serverless Workflow Specification. Accurate validation ensures that workflows adhere to defined rules and standards, making development predictable and dependable. The bug in the URI template previously led to false validation failures or confusion over accepted formats. With 1.0.0-alpha4, these issues are behind us.

## What’s Next?
The Serverless Workflow community is committed to continual improvement. This release lays the groundwork for more exciting features and enhancements in the future. Keep an eye out for updates, as the team is actively working on further refinements and new functionalities to make Serverless Workflows even more powerful and developer-friendly.
