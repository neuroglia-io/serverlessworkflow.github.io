   Introducing Catalog Support!
---

We’re excited to announce the release of **Serverless Workflow Specification 1.0.0-alpha5**, introducing a powerful new feature: **Catalogs**. A catalog is a shared space where resources like custom functions can be defined and reused. 

## Why Catalogs Matter

Catalogs simplify workflow creation by promoting **reusability** and **consistency**. By storing frequently used resources in a catalog, developers can create cleaner, more modular workflows while reducing maintenance overhead.

**We look forward to seeing how you’ll use this new feature! Join the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/discussions) to share your feedback.**
