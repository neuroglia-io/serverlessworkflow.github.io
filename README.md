# Serverless Workflow Website Repository

This repository hosts the website for the [Serveless Workflow Specification](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification) project at [https://serverlessworkflow.io](https://serverlessworkflow.io).

## ðŸ§‘ Contributing to the website

The website uses [Astro](https://astro.build/). You can find more information about how to get started with this stack [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

For the styling, it relies on [TailWind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/).

To contribute to the website you don't need to have in-deth web design knowledge:
- To publish a blog post just add a new Markdown page to the [`blog`](src/content/blog) directory. You can always use the blog posts in this repository as a reference. 
- For more complex changes to the website, have a look at the [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)
